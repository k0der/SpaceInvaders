ROLLBACK: danger-zone penalty depth overwhelms strategic signals — COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY -20000→-10000 — blocked at test phase (win rate unchanged 51%, 102/200). Halving COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY breaks asteroid avoidance: AI prefers crashing into asteroid (score -4131.8) over turning to dodge (score -9215.5). Root cause: single constant controls both actual collision deterrence and near-miss penalty; cannot reduce one without the other. Structural fix required: split into separate COLLISION_PENALTY and DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY constants.
