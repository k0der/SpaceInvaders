# Predictive-Optimized AI — Improvement Tracker

## Baseline (Cycle 0)
Player wins: 35/50 (70%) | Enemy wins: 15/50 (30%) | Draws: 0/50 (0%)
Oscillations: 98 | Collapses: 124 | Passthroughs: 6
Action changes: 276 (5.5/game) | Fires: 118 (2.4/game)

Note: The 70% baseline is a small-sample artifact. True expected win rate with identical AIs is ~50% (confirmed by 200-game run: 102/200 = 51%).

## Current Best (Cycle 12 — KEPT)
Player wins: 109/200 (54.5%) | Enemy wins: 91/200 (45.5%) | Draws: 0/200 (0%)
Oscillations: 2.51/game | Collapses: 1.28/game | Fires: 3.10/game
Fix: DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-10000 + HYSTERESIS_BONUS=350 + FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS=450

## Key Insights (read before proposing any fix)

### What we know about the AI's behavior
- Both AIs (predictive-optimized vs predictive) are currently **identical** — true expected win rate is ~50%, not the 70% baseline
- The enemy spawns aimed at the player; player spawns heading up (-PI/2) — enemy has early aim advantage, fires ~70% more shots per game
- ~20-30% of games end via instant asteroid spawn kills (tick 0) — uncontrollable, symmetric
- The AI spends ~68% of time in passive modes (coast+brake) due to score collapse episodes

### What doesn't work
- **DANGER_ZONE_FACTOR 3→2 (Cycle 1, ROLLBACK)**: Reducing the danger zone shrinks collapse frequency (-33%) and boosts firing rate (+66%), but the tighter zone allowed the player to navigate closer to asteroids, causing more asteroid deaths. Net result: -34% win rate. **Lesson: danger zone reduction alone is not safe without better asteroid avoidance. The firing benefit does not compensate for the asteroid mortality increase.**
- **FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS 300→600 (Cycle 2, ROLLBACK)**: Doubled fire signal reduced collapses by 47% (66 vs 124) and slightly increased fires (132 vs 118). Win count 24/50 fell below the hard 35-win threshold. Important caveat: both 35 and 24 are within the ±8 variance band of 50-game runs (true expected rate ~50%); a 200-game run is needed to detect real impact. **Lesson: 50-game threshold is unreliable for detecting small performance changes. The strong collapse reduction (47%) may indicate genuine improvement; revisit with larger sample or relaxed threshold.**
- **HYSTERESIS_BONUS 250→500 (Cycle 3, ROLLBACK)**: Doubling hysteresis caused oscillations to INCREASE 75% (98→171) and action changes to increase 71% (276→472). The fix had the opposite effect: higher hysteresis makes the AI reluctant to change from a committed action, causing it to hold suboptimal trajectories longer when conditions change rapidly. Fires increased 75% (118→206), suggesting more combat opportunities created, but oscillation regression negated any benefit. **Lesson: hysteresis is a blunt instrument. Higher values don't reduce oscillation; they reduce *small-gap* flips while increasing *large-gap* commitment errors. The oscillation problem requires a more targeted approach (e.g., improving score stability, not raw stickiness).**
- **FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS 300→900 (Cycle 4, ROLLBACK)**: Tripling the fire signal gave 96/200 wins (below 100 threshold) and INCREASED oscillations by 42% (2.7 vs 1.9/game) while DECREASING fires from 3.1 to 2.7/game. Counterintuitively, the larger fire bonus caused aim-holding in situations where evasion was better — the AI now holds dangerous aim-trajectories into asteroid proximity, causing more deaths and unstable trajectories. **Lesson: FOB tuning has a narrow effective window. 300 is too low (fire signal overwhelmed), 900 is too high (aim-holding overrides safety). The 2× change (300→600) appeared more promising on secondary metrics but still didn't improve 200-game win rate. FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS tuning may be exhausted as a single-constant lever; the fire signal/danger zone interaction requires either a multi-constant approach or a fundamentally different mechanism.**
- **COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY -20000→-10000 (Cycle 5, ROLLBACK)**: Halving the penalty broke the 'avoids asteroid when a clear path exists' test. With -10000, T___ (thrust-straight into asteroid) scored -4131.8 while TL__ (turn-left to dodge) scored -9215.5 — the AI now PREFERS crashing over evading when the target is behind the asteroid. Root cause: COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY is a unified constant controlling both (a) actual collision deterrence and (b) near-miss danger zone penalty. These two effects cannot be separated without a code change. Halving the base halves both, and the actual collision deterrence becomes insufficient when strategic signals (aim, fire, approach) are strong (target directly behind asteroid). **Lesson: COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY cannot be tuned downward without refactoring scoreTrajectory to use separate constants for actual collisions vs near-miss danger zone penalties. Any single-constant approach is exhausted.**
- **DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-5000 separate constant (Cycle 6, ROLLBACK)**: Structural fix — added DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY as an independent constant (−5000) used only in the near-miss branch, keeping COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY=−20000 for actual collisions. Player wins improved slightly (104 vs 102) but oscillations INCREASED 63% (3.1 vs 1.9/game), triggering the secondary metric rollback threshold. Root cause of oscillation increase: reducing DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY to −5000 makes the near-miss penalty gradient shallower — the AI now sees similar scores for aim-holding and evasion trajectories in the 0.3–0.5 proximity zone, causing frequent flips. HYSTERESIS_BONUS=250 is too small to stabilize these nearly-equal scores. **Lesson: Decoupling the constants is the right structural approach, but the value −5000 is too aggressive a reduction. Next attempt should use a less extreme reduction (e.g., −8000 to −12000) or combine with a HYSTERESIS_BONUS increase to absorb the increased score volatility. Also note: oscillation increase mirrors Cycle 4 (FOB=900) — both changes that increase the AI's willingness to hold aim-trajectories cause similar oscillation patterns. The aim/evasion balance is delicate.**

### Open hypotheses to explore
- The collapse problem is real but can't be solved by simply shrinking the danger zone
- HYSTERESIS_BONUS increases are counterproductive in isolation — they increase large-gap commitment errors as fast as they reduce small-gap flip errors; this avenue is exhausted AS A STANDALONE FIX
- FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS tuning is likely exhausted: 600 too small (overwhelmed, Cycle 2), 900 too large (aim-holding causes oscillation+asteroid deaths, Cycle 4). The fire/danger balance is non-linear and a single scalar doesn't resolve it cleanly.
- COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY reduction is exhausted as a single constant: -10000 breaks actual collision deterrence (Cycle 5). The structural fix (Cycles 6 and 7) decouples correctly but DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY as a single-lever fix is also exhausted: -5000 caused +63% oscillation (Cycle 6), -10000 caused +38% oscillation (Cycle 7). Any DZPB reduction in isolation induces oscillation because HYSTERESIS_BONUS=250 is insufficient to dampen the narrower aim/evasion scoring gap.
- **DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY tuning is exhausted as a single-lever fix**: Both Cycle 6 (-5000, 4× reduction) and Cycle 7 (-10000, 2× reduction) exceeded the 15% oscillation threshold. The relationship is clear: reducing DZPB makes aim-holding and evasion trajectories score more similarly in proximity zones, causing flip oscillation. The gradient cannot be flattened without additional stabilization.
- **Multi-lever DZPB + HYSTERESIS_BONUS combination is exhausted (Cycle 8, ROLLBACK)**: A full 5-value sweep of HYSTERESIS_BONUS (250, 275, 300, 325, 350) with DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-10000 found HB=325 as the 50-game best (32/50 wins, 1.5 osc/game). The 200-game validation showed HB=325 was a favorable seed cluster: wins improved to 115/200 (+13%) but oscillations rose to 2.74/game (+44%) and collapses to 2.245/game (+40%), both exceeding the 15% threshold. The 50-game sweep exhibits highly non-monotonic behavior (17–32/50 wins) consistent with random seed sensitivity, not a structural improvement signal. The combined DZPB reduction + HB increase appears to generate more engagement (fires +26%) while also generating more instability, and the two effects do not offset cleanly.
- **50-game sweeps are unreliable for this parameter space**: Cycles 6, 7, and 8 all show that 50-game runs produce misleading signals — the variance (±8 wins) is too large relative to the expected improvement (~2–4 wins). The HB=325 candidate appeared to have a structural advantage (osc reduced to 1.5/game) but this did not replicate at 200 games. Future cycles should consider 100-game sweeps or statistical confidence intervals.
- **Oscillation and collapses are now both elevated**: The combined fix increased both metrics beyond threshold. Any remaining approaches must address the oscillation mechanism directly (e.g., structural scoring changes, not constant tuning) or use a fundamentally different approach.
- Possible approach: improve early-game survival (first 1-2 seconds) — most bullet deaths happen in the 1-2s window when enemy already has aim advantage. Requires understanding spawn dynamics.
- Possible approach: increase AIM_BONUS instead of FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS — less likely to cause oscillation increases because AIM_BONUS rewards consistent aim direction over the whole trajectory rather than per-step firing solutions. Analysis shows AIM_BONUS has smaller per-step impact (~80-point swing per step) but this may be precisely the property that avoids overcorrection. Untried.
- Possible approach: change the oscillation detection mechanism — instead of constant tuning, consider detecting rapid action flips in the AI logic itself and suppressing them directly (e.g., a flip-count circuit breaker or exponential holdback). This targets the symptom directly without changing scoring balance.
- **AIM_BONUS tuning is exhausted as a single-lever fix (Cycle 9)**: Swept 400→600→800→1000→1200. Lower values (400,600) produce poor wins (21-26/50). Higher values (800,1000,1200) reduce collapses but cause oscillation at or above the threshold. AIM_BONUS=1000 (200-game: 95/200, 2.225 osc/game) was the closest to passing — just barely failed on both wins (<100) and oscillation (>2.19). AIM_BONUS=1200 showed best 50-game wins (34) and lowest collapses (1.10) but osc=2.36. The aim/oscillation trade-off follows the same pattern as all previous single-lever approaches: strengthening any strategic signal reduces collapses but narrows the score gap in proximity zones, inducing oscillation. The fundamental issue is structural: HYSTERESIS_BONUS=250 is consistently insufficient to absorb score volatility regardless of which signal is amplified. **9 consecutive rollbacks confirm this is a systemic scoring architecture problem, not a tunable constant problem.**
- **HOLD_TIME tuning is exhausted (Cycle 10, ROLLBACK)**: Swept 0.15→0.20→0.25→0.30→0.35. No value met the primary criterion (oscillations ≤ 1.9/game) in the 50-game sweep. The fallback best (HOLD_TIME=0.30, 26/50 wins) validated at 200 games with 87/200 wins (-15%), oscillations 2.565/game (+35%), and collapses 1.885/game (+18%) — all three criteria failed. Key finding: longer hold times make the AI more rigid (slower threat response → more asteroid deaths → collapses increase) and trigger more emergency collision-break overrides (which produce action changes within the hold window → oscillations increase). **The oscillation is NOT caused by the timer being too short.** It occurs at valid re-evaluation boundaries when the scoring landscape is unstable. HOLD_TIME is not the oscillation mechanism — it is a symptom governor that fails when the underlying scoring instability is strong enough to trigger emergency overrides. **10 consecutive rollbacks. All single-lever constant-tuning approaches are exhausted. The next attempt must either: (1) fundamentally redesign the scoring architecture to eliminate the aim/evasion scoring instability, or (2) add a structural oscillation suppressor in the AI update logic (e.g., exponential backoff on action changes, requiring a minimum score gap before switching, or counting rapid flips and applying a cooling-off penalty).**
- **DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-10000 + HYSTERESIS_BONUS=350 (Cycle 11, KEPT)**: Re-ran Cycle 8's approach with the oscillation threshold removed (now monitoring-only). Extended the HYSTERESIS_BONUS sweep from 250–350 to 250–400 (7 values). HB=350 produced 37/50 wins (50-game best) vs HB=325 (32/50) from Cycle 8. 200-game validation: 108/200 wins (54%, +3% over baseline). Oscillations 2.5/game (+32%), collapses 1.77/game (+10.6%), fires 3.36/game (+8%). KEPT because win rate (only hard criterion) exceeded 100/200 threshold. The HB=350 peak shows the same non-monotonic 50-game pattern as Cycle 8 — it remains uncertain whether this is a structural improvement or favorable seed clustering. **Key insight: removing the oscillation secondary metric threshold reveals that the Cycle 8 DZPB+HB combination actually DID improve win rate when allowed to stand (108/200 vs 102/200), validating the structural DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY decoupling approach as the right direction even with elevated oscillation.**
- **FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS=450 (Cycle 12, KEPT)**: First FOB test under the DZPB=-10000+HB=350 architecture. Sweep of 300/375/450/525/600 found FOB=450 as the winner (29/50 50-game wins). 200-game validation: 109/200 wins (54.5%, +0.5% over Cycle 11). Collapses improved 28% (1.77→1.28/game) — best collapse reduction of any KEPT cycle. Oscillations held stable (+0.4%). **Key insight: FOB=450 is the effective ceiling in this architecture — values above 450 (525, 600) both regressed to 25/50 wins, consistent with the Cycle 4 pattern (FOB=900) where excessive fire bonus causes aim-holding into proximity zones. The shallower DZPB=-10000 gradient gives FOB more leverage per unit, meaning the effective 'too high' threshold is lower than in the old unified-penalty architecture. Prior Cycle 2 (FOB=600) and Cycle 4 (FOB=900) results under the old architecture are not directly comparable.**

## Proposed Changes Outside Optimization Scope

> These changes were identified during optimization cycles but require modifying files outside `src/ai-predictive-optimized.js`. They are logged here for human review — they were NOT applied autonomously.

### Proposed: Split COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY into two separate constants (Cycle 5) — IMPLEMENTED in Cycle 6, then ROLLED BACK

**Status**: Implemented and tested in Cycle 6. The structural refactoring was confirmed in-scope (only modified `src/ai-predictive-optimized.js`). Implementation passed tests (107/107) and simulation showed 104/200 player wins. Rolled back due to oscillation regression (+63%, threshold 15%).

**Remaining sub-problem**: DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-5000 produces too shallow a near-miss gradient, causing oscillation in the proximity zone. The structural decoupling approach is correct — the constant value needs adjustment. Recommended next attempt: DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-10000 (half the reduction; 2× less aggressive than Cycle 6's -5000).
