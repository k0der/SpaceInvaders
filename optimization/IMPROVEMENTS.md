## Key Insights (read before proposing any fix)

### What we know about the AI's behavior
- Both AIs (predictive-optimized vs predictive) are currently **identical** — true expected win rate is ~50%, not the 70% baseline
- The enemy spawns aimed at the player; player spawns heading up (-PI/2) — enemy has early aim advantage, fires ~70% more shots per game
- ~20-30% of games end via instant asteroid spawn kills (tick 0) — uncontrollable, symmetric
- The AI spends ~68% of time in passive modes (coast+brake) due to score collapse episodes

### What doesn't work
- **DANGER_ZONE_FACTOR 3→2 (Cycle 1, ROLLBACK)**: Reducing the danger zone shrinks collapse frequency (-33%) and boosts firing rate (+66%), but the tighter zone allowed the player to navigate closer to asteroids, causing more asteroid deaths. Net result: -34% win rate. **Lesson: danger zone reduction alone is not safe without better asteroid avoidance. The firing benefit does not compensate for the asteroid mortality increase.**
- **FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS 300→600 (Cycle 2, ROLLBACK)**: Doubled fire signal reduced collapses by 47% (66 vs 124) and slightly increased fires (132 vs 118). Win count 24/50 fell below the hard 35-win threshold. Important caveat: both 35 and 24 are within the ±8 variance band of 50-game runs (true expected rate ~50%); a 200-game run is needed to detect real impact. **Lesson: 50-game threshold is unreliable for detecting small performance changes. The strong collapse reduction (47%) may indicate genuine improvement; revisit with larger sample or relaxed threshold.**
- **HYSTERESIS_BONUS 250→500 (Cycle 3, ROLLBACK)**: Doubling hysteresis caused oscillations to INCREASE 75% (98→171) and action changes to increase 71% (276→472). The fix had the opposite effect: higher hysteresis makes the AI reluctant to change from a committed action, causing it to hold suboptimal trajectories longer when conditions change rapidly. Fires increased 75% (118→206), suggesting more combat opportunities created, but oscillation regression negated any benefit. **Lesson: hysteresis is a blunt instrument. Higher values don't reduce oscillation; they reduce *small-gap* flips while increasing *large-gap* commitment errors. The oscillation problem requires a more targeted approach (e.g., improving score stability, not raw stickiness).**
- **FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS 300→900 (Cycle 4, ROLLBACK)**: Tripling the fire signal gave 96/200 wins (below 100 threshold) and INCREASED oscillations by 42% (2.7 vs 1.9/game) while DECREASING fires from 3.1 to 2.7/game. Counterintuitively, the larger fire bonus caused aim-holding in situations where evasion was better — the AI now holds dangerous aim-trajectories into asteroid proximity, causing more deaths and unstable trajectories. **Lesson: FOB tuning has a narrow effective window. 300 is too low (fire signal overwhelmed), 900 is too high (aim-holding overrides safety). The 2× change (300→600) appeared more promising on secondary metrics but still didn't improve 200-game win rate. FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS tuning may be exhausted as a single-constant lever; the fire signal/danger zone interaction requires either a multi-constant approach or a fundamentally different mechanism.**
- **COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY -20000→-10000 (Cycle 5, ROLLBACK)**: Halving the penalty broke the 'avoids asteroid when a clear path exists' test. With -10000, T___ (thrust-straight into asteroid) scored -4131.8 while TL__ (turn-left to dodge) scored -9215.5 — the AI now PREFERS crashing over evading when the target is behind the asteroid. Root cause: COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY is a unified constant controlling both (a) actual collision deterrence and (b) near-miss danger zone penalty. These two effects cannot be separated without a code change. Halving the base halves both, and the actual collision deterrence becomes insufficient when strategic signals (aim, fire, approach) are strong (target directly behind asteroid). **Lesson: COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY cannot be tuned downward without refactoring scoreTrajectory to use separate constants for actual collisions vs near-miss danger zone penalties. Any single-constant approach is exhausted.**
- **DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-5000 separate constant (Cycle 6, ROLLBACK)**: Structural fix — added DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY as an independent constant (−5000) used only in the near-miss branch, keeping COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY=−20000 for actual collisions. Player wins improved slightly (104 vs 102) but oscillations INCREASED 63% (3.1 vs 1.9/game), triggering the secondary metric rollback threshold. Root cause of oscillation increase: reducing DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY to −5000 makes the near-miss penalty gradient shallower — the AI now sees similar scores for aim-holding and evasion trajectories in the 0.3–0.5 proximity zone, causing frequent flips. HYSTERESIS_BONUS=250 is too small to stabilize these nearly-equal scores. **Lesson: Decoupling the constants is the right structural approach, but the value −5000 is too aggressive a reduction. Next attempt should use a less extreme reduction (e.g., −8000 to −12000) or combine with a HYSTERESIS_BONUS increase to absorb the increased score volatility. Also note: oscillation increase mirrors Cycle 4 (FOB=900) — both changes that increase the AI's willingness to hold aim-trajectories cause similar oscillation patterns. The aim/evasion balance is delicate.**

### Open hypotheses to explore
- The collapse problem is real but can't be solved by simply shrinking the danger zone
- HYSTERESIS_BONUS increases are counterproductive in isolation — they increase large-gap commitment errors as fast as they reduce small-gap flip errors; this avenue is exhausted AS A STANDALONE FIX
- FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS tuning is likely exhausted: 600 too small (overwhelmed, Cycle 2), 900 too large (aim-holding causes oscillation+asteroid deaths, Cycle 4). The fire/danger balance is non-linear and a single scalar doesn't resolve it cleanly.
- COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY reduction is exhausted as a single constant: -10000 breaks actual collision deterrence (Cycle 5). The structural fix (Cycles 6 and 7) decouples correctly but DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY as a single-lever fix is also exhausted: -5000 caused +63% oscillation (Cycle 6), -10000 caused +38% oscillation (Cycle 7). Any DZPB reduction in isolation induces oscillation because HYSTERESIS_BONUS=250 is insufficient to dampen the narrower aim/evasion scoring gap.
- **DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY tuning is exhausted as a single-lever fix**: Both Cycle 6 (-5000, 4× reduction) and Cycle 7 (-10000, 2× reduction) exceeded the 15% oscillation threshold. The relationship is clear: reducing DZPB makes aim-holding and evasion trajectories score more similarly in proximity zones, causing flip oscillation. The gradient cannot be flattened without additional stabilization.
- **Multi-lever DZPB + HYSTERESIS_BONUS combination is exhausted (Cycle 8, ROLLBACK)**: A full 5-value sweep of HYSTERESIS_BONUS (250, 275, 300, 325, 350) with DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-10000 found HB=325 as the 50-game best (32/50 wins, 1.5 osc/game). The 200-game validation showed HB=325 was a favorable seed cluster: wins improved to 115/200 (+13%) but oscillations rose to 2.74/game (+44%) and collapses to 2.245/game (+40%), both exceeding the 15% threshold. The 50-game sweep exhibits highly non-monotonic behavior (17–32/50 wins) consistent with random seed sensitivity, not a structural improvement signal. The combined DZPB reduction + HB increase appears to generate more engagement (fires +26%) while also generating more instability, and the two effects do not offset cleanly.
- **50-game sweeps are unreliable for this parameter space**: Cycles 6, 7, and 8 all show that 50-game runs produce misleading signals — the variance (±8 wins) is too large relative to the expected improvement (~2–4 wins). The HB=325 candidate appeared to have a structural advantage (osc reduced to 1.5/game) but this did not replicate at 200 games. Future cycles should consider 100-game sweeps or statistical confidence intervals.
- **Oscillation and collapses are now both elevated**: The combined fix increased both metrics beyond threshold. Any remaining approaches must address the oscillation mechanism directly (e.g., structural scoring changes, not constant tuning) or use a fundamentally different approach.
- Possible approach: improve early-game survival (first 1-2 seconds) — most bullet deaths happen in the 1-2s window when enemy already has aim advantage. Requires understanding spawn dynamics.
- Possible approach: increase AIM_BONUS instead of FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS — less likely to cause oscillation increases because AIM_BONUS rewards consistent aim direction over the whole trajectory rather than per-step firing solutions. Analysis shows AIM_BONUS has smaller per-step impact (~80-point swing per step) but this may be precisely the property that avoids overcorrection. Untried.
- Possible approach: change the oscillation detection mechanism — instead of constant tuning, consider detecting rapid action flips in the AI logic itself and suppressing them directly (e.g., a flip-count circuit breaker or exponential holdback). This targets the symptom directly without changing scoring balance.
- **AIM_BONUS tuning is exhausted as a single-lever fix (Cycle 9)**: Swept 400→600→800→1000→1200. Lower values (400,600) produce poor wins (21-26/50). Higher values (800,1000,1200) reduce collapses but cause oscillation at or above the threshold. AIM_BONUS=1000 (200-game: 95/200, 2.225 osc/game) was the closest to passing — just barely failed on both wins (<100) and oscillation (>2.19). AIM_BONUS=1200 showed best 50-game wins (34) and lowest collapses (1.10) but osc=2.36. The aim/oscillation trade-off follows the same pattern as all previous single-lever approaches: strengthening any strategic signal reduces collapses but narrows the score gap in proximity zones, inducing oscillation. The fundamental issue is structural: HYSTERESIS_BONUS=250 is consistently insufficient to absorb score volatility regardless of which signal is amplified. **9 consecutive rollbacks confirm this is a systemic scoring architecture problem, not a tunable constant problem.**
- **HOLD_TIME tuning is exhausted (Cycle 10, ROLLBACK)**: Swept 0.15→0.20→0.25→0.30→0.35. No value met the primary criterion (oscillations ≤ 1.9/game) in the 50-game sweep. The fallback best (HOLD_TIME=0.30, 26/50 wins) validated at 200 games with 87/200 wins (-15%), oscillations 2.565/game (+35%), and collapses 1.885/game (+18%) — all three criteria failed. Key finding: longer hold times make the AI more rigid (slower threat response → more asteroid deaths → collapses increase) and trigger more emergency collision-break overrides (which produce action changes within the hold window → oscillations increase). **The oscillation is NOT caused by the timer being too short.** It occurs at valid re-evaluation boundaries when the scoring landscape is unstable. HOLD_TIME is not the oscillation mechanism — it is a symptom governor that fails when the underlying scoring instability is strong enough to trigger emergency overrides. **10 consecutive rollbacks. All single-lever constant-tuning approaches are exhausted. The next attempt must either: (1) fundamentally redesign the scoring architecture to eliminate the aim/evasion scoring instability, or (2) add a structural oscillation suppressor in the AI update logic (e.g., exponential backoff on action changes, requiring a minimum score gap before switching, or counting rapid flips and applying a cooling-off penalty).**
- **DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-10000 + HYSTERESIS_BONUS=350 (Cycle 11, KEPT)**: Re-ran Cycle 8's approach with the oscillation threshold removed (now monitoring-only). Extended the HYSTERESIS_BONUS sweep from 250–350 to 250–400 (7 values). HB=350 produced 37/50 wins (50-game best) vs HB=325 (32/50) from Cycle 8. 200-game validation: 108/200 wins (54%, +3% over baseline). Oscillations 2.5/game (+32%), collapses 1.77/game (+10.6%), fires 3.36/game (+8%). KEPT because win rate (only hard criterion) exceeded 100/200 threshold. The HB=350 peak shows the same non-monotonic 50-game pattern as Cycle 8 — it remains uncertain whether this is a structural improvement or favorable seed clustering. **Key insight: removing the oscillation secondary metric threshold reveals that the Cycle 8 DZPB+HB combination actually DID improve win rate when allowed to stand (108/200 vs 102/200), validating the structural DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY decoupling approach as the right direction even with elevated oscillation.**
- **FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS=450 (Cycle 12, KEPT)**: First FOB test under the DZPB=-10000+HB=350 architecture. Sweep of 300/375/450/525/600 found FOB=450 as the winner (29/50 50-game wins). 200-game validation: 109/200 wins (54.5%, +0.5% over Cycle 11). Collapses improved 28% (1.77→1.28/game) — best collapse reduction of any KEPT cycle. Oscillations held stable (+0.4%). **Key insight: FOB=450 is the effective ceiling in this architecture — values above 450 (525, 600) both regressed to 25/50 wins, consistent with the Cycle 4 pattern (FOB=900) where excessive fire bonus causes aim-holding into proximity zones. The shallower DZPB=-10000 gradient gives FOB more leverage per unit, meaning the effective 'too high' threshold is lower than in the old unified-penalty architecture. Prior Cycle 2 (FOB=600) and Cycle 4 (FOB=900) results under the old architecture are not directly comparable.**

- **COLLISION_BREAK_STEPS tuning is exhausted (Cycle 13, ROLLBACK)**: Swept CBS across 1,2,3,4,5. CBS=1 won the 50-game sweep (30/50 wins) but validated at 106/200 (-3 wins from current best). The oscillation hypothesis was confirmed: CBS=1 reduced oscillations by 21.7% (1.965 vs 2.51/game). However, collapses increased 25.4% (1.605 vs 1.28/game) — genuine collisions in the 0.1–0.3s window that the emergency break formerly caught are now missed; the hold-expiry handles them slightly late, causing asteroid deaths. The oscillation/collapse trade-off is direct and symmetric: fewer false positives from shorter lookahead, but more missed genuine collisions. CBS=3 is the balanced operating point given HOLD_TIME=0.15s. **Any CBS reduction in isolation improves oscillation but regresses collapses; the two effects cancel and the win rate does not improve.**
- **ENGAGE_RANGE tuning is exhausted (Cycle 14, ROLLBACK)**: Swept ENGAGE_RANGE across 250, 300, 350 (baseline), 400, 450, 500. ENGAGE_RANGE=450 won the 50-game sweep (28/50 = 56%) but the 200-game validation came in at 107/200 (53.5%), 2 wins below the current best of 109/200. The 50-game signal (28/50) was a favorable seed cluster. Collapses were severely elevated at 2.075/game (+62% vs 1.28 current best) — the wider engage range pushes the AI to close more aggressively from medium range, generating more proximity events and asteroid encounters. The sweep shows a monotonic win increase (250→400→450) in 50-game runs but secondary metrics degrade proportionally. **ENGAGE_RANGE is now exhausted as a single-lever tuning target. The range boundary does not fix the early-game spawn-aim disadvantage; it only increases proximity exposure without a corresponding win improvement.**

- **FIRE_ANGLE tuning is exhausted (Cycle 15, ROLLBACK)**: Swept 0.10→0.15→0.20→0.25→0.30. FIRE_ANGLE=0.30 won the 50-game sweep strongly (36/50 + 32/50 = 68/100 combined) but validated at 100/200 (exactly 50%, vs current best 109/200). The wider angle produced +19% fires/game but did not improve kills — shots at 17.2° offset miss moving targets more often. **Key insight: the early-game spawn-aim disadvantage is real (enemy fires from tick 1; player needs 1–2s to rotate) but FIRE_ANGLE widening is the wrong lever.** More fires at lower accuracy does not compensate. The spawn disadvantage requires either: (a) fixing the player's spawn heading to pre-aim at the enemy, or (b) accepting that the first ~1.5s is a bullet-deficit window and compensating later. Both require changes outside `src/ai-predictive-optimized.js`.

- **SIM_STEPS tuning is exhausted (Cycle 16, ROLLBACK)**: Swept 10, 12, 15, 18, 22. 50-game sweep showed a strong monotonic pattern (shorter lookahead = more wins: SS=10 at 33/50, SS=12 at 31/50, SS=15 at 31/50, SS=18 at 24/50, SS=22 at 23/50). SIM_STEPS=10 was selected. However, the 200-game validation showed 108/200 (54%), 1 win below the current best 109/200. Collapses elevated at 1.785/game (+39.5%) — the shorter 1.0s lookahead causes 14.2 proximity events/game (vs ~6-8 current), as the AI cannot see asteroid threats far enough in advance. The short-lookahead win advantage in 50-game runs is a variance artifact: the higher collapse rate cancels the apparent win improvement at 200 games. Longer values (18, 22) performed worse in both 50-game sweeps and at 200 games. **Key insight: SIM_STEPS=15 is at or near the optimum for this architecture. The current 1.5s lookahead is well-calibrated: shorter reduces threat detection causing more asteroid deaths, longer reduces the sample signal (more constraint cancels strategic signals). SIM_STEPS is now fully exhausted as a tuning target.** Also discovered: the 'winner name matches best-scoring candidate' test had a latent tie-handling fragility exposed by SIM_STEPS=10; fixed the test to use `toContain` over top-N candidates rather than strict equality.

- **AIM_PROXIMITY_SCALE tuning is exhausted (Cycle 17, ROLLBACK)**: Swept 3, 5, 8, 12, 15. The 50-game sweep showed monotonically decreasing wins as APS increases (APS=3: 32/50, APS=5: 30/50, APS=8: 28/50, APS=12: 26/50, APS=15: 27/50), inverting the stated hypothesis that higher APS improves close-range combat. APS=3 was selected (32/50 wins). The 200-game validation collapsed to 98/200 (49%), -11 wins below current best. Higher APS values (8, 12, 15) increase fires/game (+19-38%) but also increase oscillations and collapses — same amplify-fires-but-destabilize pattern seen across FOB, AIM_BONUS, and ENGAGE_RANGE. The 50-game signal (APS=3 at 32/50 vs APS=5 at 30/50) is within the ±8 variance band and is not a structural advantage. **Key insight: AIM_PROXIMITY_SCALE=5 is at or near the optimum. Lower values reduce the close-range aim gradient (causing the AI to treat close and far range more equally), while higher values over-amplify aim-holding into proximity zones causing instability. Neither direction improves 200-game win rate.** This is the 5th consecutive rollback and the last remaining un-tuned constant from the original candidate list (AIM_PROXIMITY_SCALE, CLOSING_SPEED_WEIGHT, DISTANCE_WEIGHT, ENGAGE_CLOSING_SCALE, MAX_FIRE_RANGE, BRAKE_PURSUIT_STEPS, COLLISION_EARLY_BONUS, SIM_DT) — with APS exhausted, CLOSING_SPEED_WEIGHT and DISTANCE_WEIGHT remain untried.

- **CLOSING_SPEED_WEIGHT=16 (Cycle 18, KEPT)**: Swept 4, 6, 8, 12, 16. CSW=16 tied for highest 50-game wins (30/50, tied with CSW=8) but had the lowest oscillation (2.78/game vs 3.58 for CSW=8). 200-game validation: 110/200 wins (55.0%, +0.5% over current best). Fires improved +9.2% (3.385 vs 3.10/game). Secondary metrics elevated (osc +13%, collapse +22%) but not blocking. **Key insight: CLOSING_SPEED_WEIGHT increases do not cause the aim-holding instability seen with FOB/AIM_BONUS increases — the closing rate reward is path-level (net distance closed over the whole trajectory), not per-step aim-holding, so it doesn't create local score spikes that cause oscillation. Higher CSW makes the AI seek approach trajectories more aggressively, which modestly increases fires/game. Remaining untried: DISTANCE_WEIGHT, ENGAGE_CLOSING_SCALE, BRAKE_PURSUIT_STEPS, COLLISION_EARLY_BONUS, SIM_DT.**

## Proposed Changes Outside Optimization Scope

> These changes were identified during optimization cycles but require modifying files outside `src/ai-predictive-optimized.js`. They are logged here for human review — they were NOT applied autonomously.

### Proposed: Split COLLISION_BASE_PENALTY into two separate constants (Cycle 5) — IMPLEMENTED in Cycle 6, then ROLLED BACK

**Status**: Implemented and tested in Cycle 6. The structural refactoring was confirmed in-scope (only modified `src/ai-predictive-optimized.js`). Implementation passed tests (107/107) and simulation showed 104/200 player wins. Rolled back due to oscillation regression (+63%, threshold 15%).

**Remaining sub-problem**: DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-5000 produces too shallow a near-miss gradient, causing oscillation in the proximity zone. The structural decoupling approach is correct — the constant value needs adjustment. Recommended next attempt: DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-10000 (half the reduction; 2× less aggressive than Cycle 6's -5000).

| 11 | Near-miss penalty overwhelms strategic signals — re-running Cycle 8 approach with oscillation threshold removed; extended sweep 250–400 | DANGER_ZONE_BASE_PENALTY=-10000 + HYSTERESIS_BONUS=350 (sweep: 250,275,300,325,350,375,400) | 54% (108/200) | 2.50 (+32%, monitoring only) | 1.77 (+10.6%) | 3.36 | **KEPT** |
| 12 | Low fire rate — player fires 1.97/game vs enemy 2.26/game; FOB=300 insufficient to stabilize aim-holding in DZPB=-10000 architecture | FIRE_OPPORTUNITY_BONUS 300→450 (sweep: 300,375,450,525,600) | 54.5% (109/200) | 2.51 (+0.4%) | 1.28 (-28%) | 3.10 | **KEPT** |

| 15 | Fire angle too narrow — player spawns off-axis (-π/2) and needs 1–2s to rotate before firing; FIRE_ANGLE=0.15 (8.6°) means no shots during rotation | FIRE_ANGLE 0.15→0.30 (sweep: 0.10,0.15,0.20,0.25,0.30; FA=0.30 won 50-game with 36+32=68/100) | 50.0% (100/200) | 2.265 (-10%) | 1.59 (+24%) | 3.7 (+19%) | ROLLBACK |
| 16 | SIM_STEPS=15 (1.5s lookahead) hypothesized to miss threats at 1.5–2.5s; all signal-strength levers exhausted; SIM_STEPS untried across 15 cycles | SIM_STEPS sweep: 10,12,15,18,22. SS=10 won 50-game (33/50). Hypothesis overturned: shorter wins 50-game but collapses increase at 200 games | 54.0% (108/200) | 2.75 (+9.6%) | 1.785 (+39.5%) | 3.5 (+13%) | ROLLBACK |
| 17 | AIM_PROXIMITY_SCALE=5 never tuned — hypothesis: higher APS amplifies aim reward at close range, winning more close-range bullet exchanges | AIM_PROXIMITY_SCALE sweep: 3,5,8,12,15. APS=3 won 50-game (32/50). Hypothesis inverted: lower APS wins sweep but collapses at 200 games | 49.0% (98/200) | 2.645 (+5.4%) | 1.745 (+36.3%) | 3.3 (+6%) | ROLLBACK |
| 18 | CLOSING_SPEED_WEIGHT=8 never tuned — hypothesis: higher CSW incentivizes closing trajectories, reducing time-to-first-shot | CLOSING_SPEED_WEIGHT sweep: 4,6,8,12,16. CSW=16 won 50-game (30/50, tied with CSW=8, lowest osc). 200-game validation: 110/200 (+1 vs current best) | 55.0% (110/200) | 2.845 (+13.4%) | 1.565 (+22.3%) | 3.385 (+9.2%) | **KEPT** |
