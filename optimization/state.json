However, the 50-game win count (24) was below the hard threshold (35). Note: the 35 baseline is itself a positive 50-game variance artifact (true ~50%); the true signal of this change remains unclear without a 200-game run. Rolled back per hard threshold rule."

The higher hysteresis stabilizes some actions but makes the AI slower to adapt when the optimal action genuinely changes, creating larger commitment errors. Fires did increase significantly (118→206, +75%), suggesting more engagement — but these didn't convert to wins. The win rate signal is still within 50-game variance noise, but the oscillation regression is a genuine behavioral failure."
